## Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a>

I am trying to predict for how much money each house 
In this mainly we will look at data exploration and data cleaning. we will use Linear Regression to train our model.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
If you’re going to sell a house, you need to know what price tag to put on it, for this purpose I wrote a regression algorithm to predict home prices

Also, We are interested to answer the following two questions:

 Q1: Get an overview of the our traget variable and find out what distribution its follow ? 
 
 Q2 : What are the most important  variables to our traget ?
  
 Q3: What is the best model that give us the best result ?
 
 Q4: Can you improve the accuracy of a model ?
 
## Data

House_data.csv: 2920 houses with 81 attributes, including the labels (sale prices)

With 81 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames,
Iowa, this competition challenges the data science community to predict the final price of each home.
